This is a simple script to add right-click search on TinEye to Nautilus.

PLEASE NOTE: This is the expirimental port to Gnome 3.  It very likely will crash nautilus in Gnome 2.

TinEye is a cool reverse image search tool - see http://tineye.com.

This script requires the poster package by Chris AtLee, and the script 
borrows from the documentation examples.  Poster allows submission of 
multipart encoded form data.
See: http://atlee.ca/software/poster/index.html

The Nautilus hooks were largely copied from the 'nautilus-open-terminal' 
script written by Martin Enlund.
See: /examples/open-terminal.py inside the nautilus-python package shipped
by your distro.

Since the 'open-terminal' code is released under GPL v2 and to my 
understanding the poster documentation is released into the public
domain, I've opted to release this script as GPL v2.

INSTALLING

1. Install the poster module
	- get the poster egg from http://atlee.ca/software/poster/dist/0.7.0/
	- run 'sudo easy_install poster-0.7.0-py2.6.egg'
	  (you may need to install the 'easy_install' package first)
	- To test: open a python shell and type 'import poster'.  If there is
	  no error, you should be all set.

2. Copy search_tineye.py to ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/ and make it 
   executable if necessary (chmod +x search_tineye.py).  Create the 
   'python-extensions' directory if it does not exist.

3. Log out of Gnome, log back in.

If you don't see it in the right-click menu, be sure you have
'python-nautilus' installed, and that the search_tineye.py file is 
executable.

USING

Right-click an image and select 'Search TinEye'.  The result will launch
in your default Gnome web browser.
